# Using TensorFlow Lite for Object Detection on Android in Robotics

## Overview
The TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android Demo is an open-source Android application designed to detect and classify objects in real-time using a mobile device’s camera. It leverages lightweight TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models optimized for mobile devices, making it ideal for integrating object detection into a robot’s vision system. The app can run on an Android phone mounted on a robot or an embedded Android device.

**GitHub Repository:**  
[https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android)

## Key Features
- Real-time object detection using TFLite models.
- Supports multiple models trained on the COCO dataset:
  - Quantized MobileNet SSD
  - EfficientDet Lite1
  - EfficientDet Lite2
- Fully functional Android app built with CameraX and TensorFlow Lite.
- Models are automatically downloaded via Gradle.

## Prerequisites
To run or customize this project, ensure you have the following:
- **Android Studio** (Tested with Bumblebee version or higher).
- **Physical Android Device** (API Level 24+ / Android 7.0 or higher).
- **USB Debugging Enabled** (Enable Developer mode on your device).

## Setup and Build Instructions
Follow these steps to build and run the app:

1. **Download and Open the Project**  
   - Clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
     ```
   - Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing project." Navigate to the `examples/lite/examples/object_detection/android` directory.

2. **Build Configuration**  
   - Sync the project with Gradle files and resolve any dependencies.

3. **Connect Android Device**  
   - Connect your Android device to your computer via USB.

4. **Run the App**  
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio to deploy the app to your device.

## Integrating with a Robotic System
To use this demo for robotics, follow one of these approaches:

### Option A: Mount Android Phone on Robot
1. Run the app on the Android phone.
2. Extract detected object information (from the UI or logs).
3. Establish an interface between the phone and the robot (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or USB).  
   - Example: Send detected object names or positions via socket to the robot's control board.

### Option B: Modify the App for Robot Control
Customize the app to directly interface with the robot's hardware or control system, enabling actions based on detection results.

## Conclusion
This demo offers a robust and optimized solution for real-time object detection on Android, making it highly suitable for robotics applications. By integrating Android-based vision with external robot controls, you can deploy the model, detect objects, and trigger robotic behaviors based on the detection results.
